# Modifications Made

## Project Part 1
1. Removed the existing CSS from the HTML files.
2. Added a new CSS file called `gutenberg.css` and linked it to the HTML files.
3. Changed the backgorund color to yellow-ish (to make it look like a old book).
4. Changed the font family to cursive and Times New Roman to make it look old and hand-written.
5. Changed the font-style, size and spacing to make the paragraphs easier to read.
  Specifically, I cahnged the line-height to 2.5 too.
6. Added CSS for images tag to make the images look like they are drawn on the book.
